            "My love, I’m so sorry this is coming late, but you’ve been on my mind every moment. You mean the world to me, more than words can say. I love you more deeply than you’ll ever truly know, and I feel incredibly lucky to call you mine. I wish more than anything that we could be together this Valentine’s, but even if we’re apart, know that I’m always thinking of you. My love for you only grows stronger each day. Thank you for being my Valentine, for filling my life with so much sweetness. You’re my candy, and I’m forever grateful for you."
